Post a URL to Wallabag from within Emacs.

This package provides a single function, ~wallabag-post-entry~, that posts a URL to a Wallabag instance from within Emacs. When called interactively it acts on the URL at point. 

This is a stripped down version of [[https://github.com/hugot/n2wal][hugot/n2wal]].

* Setup (with =use-package=)
Set ~wallabag-credentials~ as in the following. You can also set ~wallabag-data-dir~ to where you want the API token for communicating with the Wallabag server to be stored. Note that the =:load-path= keyword is necessary if wallabag.el is not in your Emacs' path.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package wallabag
    :load-path "~/path/to/wallabag"
    :commands wallabag-post-entry
    :config
    (setq wallabag-data-dir "~/.cache/wallabag")
    (setq wallabag-credentials
          `((client-secret  . "abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234")
            (client-id      . "abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234")
            (host           . "mywallabagurl.com"))))
#+END_SRC

The first time ~wallabag-post-entry~ is called, it will prompt you for your Wallabag username and password. It should work automatically afterwards.
